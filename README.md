# Saveboard

A command line application to save an image copied to your clipboard.

## Usage

Copy an image, then run `saveboard` to save it as a file on your computer. It will
default to saving as `clipboard-img.png` in your home directory (`~` on Linux &
`%USERPROFILE%` on Windows), but you can specify an output file by adding
`[-o/--output] PATH` to the command.
